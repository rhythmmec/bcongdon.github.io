I recently started my Summer internship at [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/). Starting at a new company with a new laptop prompted (forced) me to think about the way I have my development tools setup.<!--break-->

I'd been meening to write up a list of the tools that I use regularly, because I've often been inspired change something about my setup or try a new tool based on others' list of tools.

After a couple days at my internship, I've pretty much gotten all of my tools setup just the way that I like them. [Here](/tools)'s a list of everything that I currently use in the process of writing code and working on code-related projects.
