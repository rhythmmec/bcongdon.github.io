<h1 style="text-align: center;">Podcasts</h1>

I listen to a _lot_ of Podcasts. It's a great way to fill time that would otherwise be "dead" - commuting, walking, working out, doing household tasks, etc. I've been "into" podcasts since I got my first iPod (a refurbished 2nd Generation [iPod Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Nano#2nd_generation)) in 2007. I probably listened to more podcasts on that iPod than music. Since starting college, I've upped my podcast intake substantially. While in high school, I did a lot more driving than I do now, I have a lot more actual "commuting time" in college of walking between classes.

As far as my podcast player of choice, I used the default [Podcasts.app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8) for quite a long time. I've since switched to Marco Arment's excellent [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), and have never since looked back (it's really that good, you should use it).

Here's a list of what's currently queued up in my podcast feed:

### Legend

* :star: - On my shortlist of "great" podcasts
* :full_moon: - I listen to every episode, full stop.
* :waning_gibbous_moon: - I listen to most episodes
* :last_quarter_moon: - Occasionally listening to
* :waning_crescent_moon: - Rarely listening to

### Not Categorized

* [Do By Friday](http://dobyfriday.com/) :star::full_moon: - Weekly. Ostensibly a "Weekly Challenge Podcast" by Max Temkin, Merlin Mann, and Alex Cox. In reality, an indescribably-hilarious meta-podcast on productivity, automation, and politics. Worth listening to from the beginning, because so much of the humor is additive. This is probably the podcast that I look forward to most each week, and "save" for Saturday mornings. Not sure how long the hosts will continue to capture lightning in a bottle each week, but as of now this is unquestionably my favorite podcast.

* [Waking Up with Sam Harris](https://soundcloud.com/samharrisorg) :star::full_moon: - Weekly.

* [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/) :full_moon: - Biweekly-ish. Conversational podcast between CGP Grey and Brady Haran, both of Youtube fame.

* [Still Untitled](http://www.tested.com/still-untitled-the-adam-savage-project/) :full_moon: - Weekly.

* [Analog(ue)](https://www.relay.fm/analogue) :full_moon: - Biweekly.

* [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/) :last_quarter_moon: - Weekly. Thought provoking radio pieces exploring some specific aspect of the human condition. Absolutely adored their older episodes, recent ones can be hit-or-miss. Never fails to be insightful in some respect, similar to 'This American Life' in the best possible way.

### Tech News

* [This is Only a Test](http://www.tested.com/this-is-only-a-test/) :star::full_moon: - Weekly. I've been watching [Tested](https://www.youtube.com/user/testedcom) on Youtube for years, and love their mix of 'maker' and 'tech' content. TIOAT is probably my all-around favorite tech news podcast: you get a good mix of consumer electronics, hobbyist stuff like drones and 3D printing, emerging tech, and general science. The guests rotate out each week, so the mix of content is really excellent. This podcast manages well the balance between structure and casual conversation and is an absolutely excellent source of news and perspective.

* [The Vergecast](http://www.theverge.com/label/the-vergecast) :full_moon: - Weekly. While I've only been listening for about a month, I think that The Verge is doing some of the best tech journalism in the industry - especially their video content. This podcast often feels like more of a meta-discussion of the goings-on of The Verge in reference to what's been going on in tech, so I wouldn't really recommended it as a stand-alone source. Nevertheless, it's very entertaining and well worth a listen.

* [This Week in Tech](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech) :waning_gibbous_moon: - Weekly. Hosted by Leo Laporte, who's joined each week by a panel of tech pundits, TWIT is a thought provoking weekly conversation about trends in the tech space. I've been listening for about a year, and find TWIT to be a very reliable source of more 'business' oriented perspectives on tech. 

* [Ctrl-Walt-Delete](http://www.theverge.com/ctrl-walt-delete) :waning_gibbous_moon: - Weekly.

* [The Talk Show With John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/) :waning_gibbous_moon: - Biweekly.

* [TheWANShow](https://soundcloud.com/thewanshow) :last_quarter_moon: - Weekly. I regularly watch the [LinusTechTips](https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips) channel on Youtube for its mix of hardware reviews and computer builds. The WAN Show is the channel's livestream/podcast offshoot for weekly news. It's a pretty 'meh' source of news, but Linus and Luke usually have interesting perspectives from the 'user' and 'content creator' end of things. The format is quite entertaining, and they usually go more in depth with computer hardware (like new graphics cards or CPU architectures) than my other sources of tech news.

* [Security Now](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now) :waning_crescent_moon: - Weekly. Another podcast on the Twit.tv network, Security now has an interesting mix of internet security news and privacy-oriented takes on the week's tech news. I don't always agree with everything presented here, and I've found that it can be a bit ramblingly. However, when issues like encryption and security come up in the news, this podcast often has the most salient discussion about the relevant topics.

### Tech

* [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) :star::full_moon: - Weekly. Entertaining explorations of the 'weird side of the internet', the way people behave through the internet, and miscellaneous social *faux pas* facilitated by technology. Recommended as light entertainment.

* [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm) :full_moon: - Weekly.

* [Exponent](http://exponent.fm/) :waning_gibbous_moon: - Weekly. I was introduced to Ben Thompson and his site, Stratechery, in an interview he did with Ezra Klein. Ben has really fascinating takes on the trends in tech, and while I'm generally more interested in the engineering slant of tech, Exponent's analysis of the business of tech often casts really interesting insights onto the necessary innovations and approaches of companies on both the business and engineering ends of the spectrum. Not for the tech-uninitiated. Each episode usually leaves me with something to think about for a few days. Highly recommended.

* [Note to Self](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/notetoself) :waning_gibbous_moon: - Weekly.

* [Partially Derivative](http://www.partiallyderivative.com/) :waning_crescent_moon: - Weekly. Meaty conversations about Data Science and its applications in software engineering and abroad.


### Programming

* [Programming Throwdown](http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/) :waning_gibbous_moon: - Monthly / irregular. Have been listening for a few months now. The hosts are 2 in-industry software engineers and the general format is a different programming language or technology is highlighted each show, usually focusing on something 'up-and-coming' in the software engineering community.

* [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm/) :last_quarter_moon: - Weekly.

* [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast) :waning_crescent_moon: - Weekly.

### Productivity

* [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) :full_moon: - Biweekly.

* [The Tim Feriss Show](http://tim.blog/podcast/) :last_quarter_moon: - Weekly.

### News

* [The Gist](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gist.html) :waning_crescent_moon: - Daily. Comedic take on the daily news. Often has interesting interviews. The real value is Mike Pesca's pun-detry. Really though, pretty fantastic daily puns; what more could you want?


* [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/344098539/wait-wait-don-t-tell-me) :waning_crescent_moon: - Weekly. One of my favorite NPR shows. Comedic game-show-style take on the week's news. Worth a listen, particularly in dense news weeks, if only for a quick laugh.

### Politics

* [Vox's The Weeds](http://www.vox.com/the-weeds) :star::full_moon: - Weekly. Definitively my favorite politics podcast. Instead of focusing on the news of the week, the hosts pick a 'weeds-y' topic, like the Land-Value Tax, or a Basic Income, and discuss the really nitty-gritty policy implications of these types of ideas. Very thought provoking without philosophizing.


* [NPR Politics Podcast](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast) :waning_gibbous_moon: - 2-3 times weekly. A more traditional NPR style recap of the current week in politics. Has been heavily covering the election for the past few months. I enjoy the casual conversation between NPR reporters, which you don't tend to get in news reports. Great source of news. 


* [FiveThirtyEight Elections Podcast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/elections-podcast/) :waning_gibbous_moon: - 2-3 times weekly. A more 'weedsy' look at the week in politics. Uses a more data-driven approach to analyzing election trends. Will definitely be a good listen throughout the current election cycle. 


* [The Ezra Klein Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1081584611?mt=2) :last_quarter_moon: - Weekly. Interviews by Ezra Klein with noted individuals in a variety of fields - usually public policy or journalism. Emphasis is on presenting guests from the whole swath of the political spectrum. Very good podcast to break the 'echo chamber' of media that many find themselves in.


### Economics

* [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money) :last_quarter_moon: - Weekly. Seriously a great podcast. Explains current economic conditions with succinct anecdotes. Was a great resource during the financial crisis - when they launched - and continues to provide really crucial insights into the often opaque world of US economic policy.


* [Freakonomics Radio](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/freakonomics-radio) :waning_crescent_moon: - Weekly. Views of the world through an Economists' eyes. A bit hit-or-miss, and feels like it runs fast and loose with the facts sometimes. Still an interesting insight into economics and social sciences.
