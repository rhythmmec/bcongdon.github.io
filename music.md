## Summary

I began playing piano when I was ~4, and clarinet when I was ~11. Music has been a rich and rewarding part of my life for essentially my whole life. I've had a strong affinity for classical music from when my parents played it to me as a child up until present day.

I really enjoy the camaraderie that comes as a part of making music with others, and have met some of my closest friends in orchestras and bands that I've performed in. There is truly something transcendent about the musical experience of performance and listening that, I believe, taps deep into what it means to be human.

## Favorite Pieces

I heartily enjoy most of the Western Classical repertoire, but am particularly fond of impressionistic and modern works. *Ravel* is probably my favorite orchestral composer, and on piano it's a close tie between *Chopin* and *Liszt*.

Here is a selection of my favorite pieces with links to performances:

* [Schelomo (Bloch, Ernest)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXPR8w1DcqU)
